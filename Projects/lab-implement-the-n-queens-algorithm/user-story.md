# Implement the N-Queens Algorithm

The N-Queens problem asks you to place N queens on an N×N chessboard so that no two queens attack each other (no two share a row, column, or diagonal).

For example, if there is a 4x4 board, one valid arrangement is:

```
[1, 3, 0, 2]
```

That means that in row 0, the queen is placed in column 1; in row 1, the queen is placed in column 3; in row 2, the queen is placed in column 0; and in row 3, the queen is placed in column 2.

Visually, this arrangement looks like:

```
. Q . .
. . . Q
Q . . .
. . Q .
```

Where `Q` represents a queen and `.` represents an empty square.

In this lab, you will implement the N-Queens problem solver using the depth-first search approach.

**Objective**: Fulfill the user stories below and get all the tests to pass to complete the lab.

**User Stories**:

1. You should have a function named dfsNQueens.
2. The function should accept exactly one argument: an integer n.
3. If n is less than 1, the function should return an empty array ([]).
4. The function should return a list of solutions; each solution is itself a list of length n, where the element at index i is the column index (0-based) of the queen in row i.

**Tests**:
1. You should have a function named `dfsNQueens` that takes one argument.
2. If `n` is less than `1`, the function should return an empty array.
3. The function should return an array of solutions, where each solution is an array of length `n`.
4. `dfsNQueens(1)` should return `[[0]]`.
5. `dfsNQueens(2)` should return `[]`.
6. `dfsNQueens(3)` should return `[]`.
7. `dfsNQueens(4)` should return `[[1, 3, 0, 2], [2, 0, 3, 1]]`.
8. `dfsNQueens(5)` should return `[[0, 2, 4, 1, 3], [0, 3, 1, 4, 2], [1, 3, 0, 2, 4], [1, 4, 2, 0, 3], [2, 0, 3, 1, 4], [2, 4, 1, 3, 0], [3, 0, 2, 4, 1], [3, 1, 4, 2, 0], [4, 1, 3, 0, 2], [4, 2, 0, 3, 1]]`.
9. `dfsNQueens(5).length` should be `10`.
10. `dfsNQueens(8).length` should be `92`.
11. `dfsNQueens` should return the correct result.
